# .NET MAUI Client Manager Application
Client Manager is a cross-platform application that allows you to manage your clients with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It is built with .NET MAUI, a framework that lets you create native apps for Android, iOS, Mac, and Windows from a single C# codebase. It was created as an exercise to know the .NET MAUI framework a bit better.
